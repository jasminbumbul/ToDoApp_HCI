This is a website made as a part of "Human-Computer Interaction" course on Faculty of Information Technlogies in Mostar,BiH.

The goal of the website is to showcase some of the design patterns that are used nowadays, as well as to try to use all the concepts
that make a website great while minimising the bad examples of website elements usage.

As of this moment, the websites is designed only for mobile phones, but, the final version will be a full functional website for both
Desktop and mobile devices.
The storage part is done through the web browsers local storage.

This is only the alpha version of the app, so there is a lot more to add to it.
